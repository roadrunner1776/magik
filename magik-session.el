;;; Commentary:

;;
;;; The filter for the magik shell process is in magik-session-filter.el
;;
;; This is a new version of the gis-mode that uses a vector of marker
;; pairs rather than a list.  This allows us to move up and down the
;; array efficiently and also use things like binary search.
;;
;; Every hundred commands, a new bigger vector is created and the
;; invalid or degenerate previous commands are cleaned out - previous
;; commands are counted as degenerate if they point at a non-existent
;; buffer (cos the user killed the buffer and created a new one) or
;; have length zero (cos the user deleted the text the the markers
;; bounded).
;;
;; Unlike previous versions, the markers will mark the whole of the
;; text sent to the gis, including the dollar and the return.
;;
;; Note that all previous commands need to be kept, not just the last
;; 20 or so because the markers are the only way we can know what the
;; commands were - looking for prompts and dollars is too unreliable.
;;
;; Unlike shell-mode, we don't keep comint-last-input-start and
;; comint-last-input-end.  (??? I've changed last-input-* to
;; comint-last-input-* everywhere.  I hope this still works!)
;;
;; The previous commands are kept in a buffer local variable called
;; magik-session-prev-cmds.
;;
;; Where possible, we try to allow more than one gis to be running.
;; This gets a bit tricky for things like transmit-method-to-magik
;; because they have to know where to send the magik to.  In order to
;; simplify this, we are getting rid of the variable,
;; magik-process-name, because it is a duplicate of magik-session-buffer.  We
;; also don't ever refer to the process by its name but always by its
;; buffer - this should save any confusion with gis process naming.
;;
;; We don't rely on the form of the prompt any more.  We just rely on
;; it ending in a space.  The only place where we need to be sure is in
;; the filter.
;;
;; In this version of magik-session-mode, we don't have any automatic
;; indentation of magik-code.  The tab is just for inserting tabs and
;; nothing else.
;;
;; During a sequence of M-p and M-n commands, the actual command
;; we're looking at is recorded in the buffer-local variable,
;; magik-session-cmd-num.
;;
;; Unlike direct-gis-mode.el we keep the oldest command at the front.
;; This is fine because we can get to the end of a vector quickly.
;; We record how many commands are in our vector in the buffer-local
;; variable, magik-session-no-of-cmds.  To get rid of annoying edge
;; effects in going up and down the vector, we keep a pair of markers
;; that bound an empty bit of text at the end of the vector.
;;
;; Arbitrary decision: if a command is recalled by grabbing it with
;; the RET key, the magik-session-cmd-num is set to 0 (as if it had been
;; typed by hand) rather than the number of the command that was
;; recalled.

  "Run a Gis process in a buffer in `magik-session-mode'.

The command is typically \"sw_magik_win32\" or \"sw_magik_motif\", but
can be any interactive program such as \"csh\".

The program that is offered as a default is stored in the variable,
`magik-session-command', which you can customise.  e.g.

\(setq magik-session-command
  \"[$HOME] sw_magik_win32 -Mextdir %TEMP% -image $SMALLWORLD_GIS/images/gis.msf\"
\)
The command automatically expands environment variables using
Windows %% and Unix $ and ${} nomenclature.

You can setup a list of standard commands by setting the
default value of `magik-session-command-history'.

Prefix argument controls:
With a numeric prefix arg, switch to the Gis process of that number
where the number indicates the order it was started. The
SW->Gis Processes indicates which numbers are in use. If a Gis process
buffer is killed, its number is reused when a new Gis process is started.

With a non-numeric prefix arg, ask user for buffer name to use for
GIS.  This will default to a unique currently unused name based upon
the current value of `magik-session-buffer-default-name'.

If there is already a Gis process running in a visible window or
frame, just switch to that buffer, or prompt if more than one.  If
there is not, prompt for a command to run, and then run it."
