## Installation

These packages are available on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/). 
See [Emacs Wiki](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InstallingPackages) for instructions on how to set up and install packages.

The alternative, and recommended, way of installing [magik-mode](https://github.com/roadrunner1776/magik) is using [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package):
``` emacs-lisp
(use-package magik-mode
  :ensure t
  :config
  (magik-global-bindings)
  (magik-menu-set-menus))
```

## Features

*Global keys*

Global keys are set by calling `(magik-global-bindings)` after the packages has been loaded.

|<kbd>F2</kbd><kbd>s</kbd> | Open Magik version selection |



### magik-version

| Key | Description |
| :---: | --- |
| <kbd>Return</kbd> | Select the current selected line as the current active environment. |
| <kbd>a</kbd> | Open gis_aliases file of selected version. Will prompt for layered product to use if selected version has more than one aliases file available. |
| <kbd>+</kbd> | Add a new entry to the currently open file. |

### magik-aliases

### magik-product

### magik-msg

### magik-lint

[Magik-lint](https://github.com/StevenLooman/sonar-magik/tree/master/magik-lint) support.

To enable automatic linting in `magik-mode` buffers, the following conditions have to be met:
* Package [flycheck](https://flycheck.org) needs to be installed and loaded.
* `magik-lint-VERSION.jar` ([download](https://github.com/StevenLooman/sonar-magik/releases)) has to be installed in `~/.emacs.d/magik-lint/` (location can be customized with the variable `magik-lint-jar-file`).
* The `java` executable path should be in `exec-path`, or the variable `flycheck-magik-lint-java-executable` has to be set. `flycheck-magik-lint-java-executable` will automatically be set when the environment variable `JAVA_HOME` is set.
* `flycheck-mode` has to be enabled for `magik-mode` buffers. Or use `global-flycheck-mode` to enable it for all buffers.

## <a name="usage4x"></a>Usage with Smallworld 4.x or older

If you plan to use this package with Smallworld-Versions 4.x or older, you should consider the following points:
* Customize the variable `magik-session-auto-insert-dollar` to non nil
* You might customize the variable `magik-aliases-layered-products-file` to "$SMALLWORLD_GIS/product/config/LAYERED_PRODUCTS". But if you want to use the EMACS for Smallworld 5.x as well, it's easier to create the directory `$SMALLWORLD_GIS/../smallworld_registry` and copy or soft-link the original LAYERED_PRODUCTS file into that directory - so you have the same structure as under Smallworld 5.x.
* There is no support (yet) for the Smallworld dev-tools. So if you want to do things like <kbd>f4</kbd><kbd>d</kbd> to start debugging a method, you may still want to use the EMACS which has been delivered with the Smallworld 4.x (or older) software.
* Some more things which are at least partly not supported by Smallworld 5.x are not supported (e.g. `deep-print`)

## <a name="sideeffects"></a>Side Effects

Some keys bindings are changed with respect to a standard EMACS installation, at least when using `(magik-global-bindings)`:

| Key | Function in standard EMACS | Change in Magik Mode package |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| <kbd>F2</kbd> | `2C-command`|globally changed to prefix key |
| <kbd>F3</kbd> | `kmacro-start-macro-or-insert-counter` | globally changed to prefix key |
| <kbd>F4</kbd> | `kmacro-end-or-call-macro` | used in magik-mode and magik-session-mode as prefix key |

The reason for that is, that many Magik developpers are familiar with these bindings from former EMACS installations.

For quick usage of the keyboard-macro functions you may e.g. bind the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>F2</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>F4</kbd> combinations by putting the following lines into your  `.emacs` file:
``` emacs-lisp
(global-set-key [C-f3] 'kmacro-start-macro-or-insert-counter)
(global-set-key [C-f4] 'kmacro-end-or-call-macro)
```
