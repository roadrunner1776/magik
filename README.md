### magik-lint

[Magik-lint](https://github.com/StevenLooman/sonar-magik/tree/master/magik-lint) support.

To enable automatic linting in `magik-mode` buffers, the following conditions have to be met:
* Package [flycheck](https://flycheck.org) needs to be installed and loaded.
* `magik-lint-VERSION.jar` ([download](https://github.com/StevenLooman/sonar-magik/releases)) has to be installed in `~/.emacs.d/magik-lint/` (location can be customized with the variable `magik-lint-jar-file`).
* The `java` executable path should be in `exec-path`, or the variable `flycheck-magik-lint-java-executable` has to be set. `flycheck-magik-lint-java-executable` will automatically be set when the environment variable `JAVA_HOME` is set.
* `flycheck-mode` has to be enabled for `magik-mode` buffers. Or use `global-flycheck-mode` to enable it for all buffers.

## Usage with Smallworld 4.x or older

If you plan to use this package with Smallworld-Versions 4.x or older, you should consider the following points:
* Customize the variable `magik-session-auto-insert-dollar` to non nil
* You might customize the variable `magik-aliases-layered-products-file` to "$SMALLWORLD_GIS/product/config/LAYERED_PRODUCTS". But if you want to use the EMACS for Smallworld 5.x as well, it's easier to create the directory `$SMALLWORLD_GIS/../smallworld_registry` and copy or soft-link the original LAYERED_PRODUCTS file into that directory - so you have the same structure as under Smallworld 5.x.
* There is no support (yet) for the Smallworld dev-tools. So if you want to do things like <kbd>f4</kbd><kbd>d</kbd> to start debugging a method, you may still want to use the EMACS which has been delivered with the Smallworld 4.x (or older) software.
