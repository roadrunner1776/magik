If MATCH returns t eval the corresponding FUNCTION with the first arg being the

The optional arguments OTHER may be used by FUNCTION to modify its behaviour.
E.g. pragma-if-match-replace-with-next uses the 4th arg to specify the subexpression to replace.

Optional arg DEFAULT-ELEM (DEFAULT MATCH FUNCTION [OTHER...]) is used if no matches are obtained from the list.
If this matches then the  default's function is called with next elem set to the first elem of the list.
  (Or last if REVERSE is t).
Optional arg REVERSE reverses the given list.

This can be thought to be equivalent to creating a cond construct using the MATCH in the list
as the tests and the FUNCTION as the form to be evualated when MATCH is true.
The extra bit this provides is that the called function knows what the next elem would be.
Also being able to make up a data structure means that it is easy to add new things to test for.
